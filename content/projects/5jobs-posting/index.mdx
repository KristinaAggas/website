#### Description
This one was a bit difficult at first because there are a decent amount of job listing designs and they all look good. There's also a lot I like to know about a job before I apply to it; at the same time, I couldn't make the overall list look too busy. I made and deleted a couple versions of this challenge before I finally settled on this one. I also did a lot of consulting with colleagues to make sure I got this one right. It was all worth it though, it made the end product even more staisfying.
