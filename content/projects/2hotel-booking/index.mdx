#### Description
This challenge was a hotel booking. It's similar to my crowdfunding design with the call to action button overlapping with the image. I find this design so attractive when it's utilized well. If you interact with it, you can favorite it by clicking the heart in the top right, or move forward to the reservation screen by clicking the "Book Now" button. You can also navigate back to the information screen from the booking screen. Remember, you can't spell Relaxo without "Relax."
