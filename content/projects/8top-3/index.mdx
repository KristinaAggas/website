#### Description
I had a lot of fun with this one too. I'm a pretty big movie snob, so it was a no brainer to make a top three list of films for this "Top of 2019" challenge. At the time I created this, Joker and Parasite were still in theatres, while Endgame had already been released. This was also a bit of a bonus for me because I could place both a "Buy Tickets" and "Buy Movie" button.
