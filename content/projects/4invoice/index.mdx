##### Description
I tried to make this one minimalistic and simple above all else. It only uses a few shades of gray with everything visible without the need for scrolling or any descriptive paragrahs. Really, I just wanted this to look like a reciept. It had to be easy to understand: itemized, most important information at the top, with the call to action in clear view. I think I managed to get that all across pretty well.
