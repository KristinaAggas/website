#### Description
This is another challenge that I decided to make three versions of. A light, dark, and "realistic" version. The light version was made with the colors that I felt were simple and relaxing. The second version is simply a dark theme; I had to change the way the date was selected for clarity purposes. For the third version, I thought of a legal notepad that people take notes on and tried to emulate that in my final design.
