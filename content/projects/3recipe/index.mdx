#### Description
This one actually has a cookie recipe! I make these cookies all the time for holidays and family get togethers, so I was really excited to be able to incorporate it into one of my challenges. I tried to make this look like a recipe card, with the different tabs for ingredients and instructions. I think the slight drop shadow really helped to accentuate that as well. The pictures are stock photos, but all the other information is accurate to the recipe.
