#### Description
I really love this design because the color scheme is so simple, yet it all just "pops." The call to action was, of course, the donate button, so that had to come first. Beyond that, I think the biggest challenge was deciding whether to put the donation amount and goals before or after the description. I decided on this final design because I believe that people are more likely to donate to a campagin if they see that other people have already donated. This is defintely one of my favorites.
